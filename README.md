Project Management Web Application, built with Python and Flask, I applied my Python skills extensively to develop the backend logic, manage data flow, and integrate the application with the database. The goal of the project was to allow users to create, assign, track, and update tasks while providing managers with a clear overview of project progress.

Using Flask as the backend framework, I structured the application with modular routes and blueprints to keep the code clean and maintainable.
I also used Python to implement role-based authentication and authorization, ensuring that managers and employees had access only to the features relevant to their roles. For authentication, I leveraged Flask extensions such as Flask-Login to manage user sessions securely.

Pythonâ€™s data processing capabilities were used to generate project reports, including task completion rates and overdue task counts, which were then displayed in the web dashboard. To improve efficiency, I implemented server-side form validation in Python, preventing incorrect or incomplete submissions before they reached the database.

Additionally, I integrated the backend with Bootstrap-based HTML templates , enabling a responsive and interactive user experience.
